Introduction to JQuery Mobile with Django
=========================================

This project is intended to let you quickly get "up and running" with a JQuery Mobile web application using Django to program the web application logic.  It is not intended to provide a framework for a "serious" JQuery Mobile application, just something to make playing with JQuery Mobile easier for Python programmers.
