===========================
 JQuery Mobile with Django
===========================

This project is intended to let you quickly get "up and running" with a JQuery
Mobile web application using Django to program the web application logic.  It
is not intended to provide a framework for a "serious" JQuery Mobile
application, just something to make playing with JQuery Mobile easier for
Django programmers.

See the ``doc`` directory for documentation.
